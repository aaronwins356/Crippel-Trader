# Changelog

All notable changes to the Croc-Bot Trading System repair and hardening project.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-XX - Repair & Hardening Release

### üîß Fixed

#### Models & Validation (Pydantic v2)
- **TradeStat model**: Added safe default values for all fields (total_trades=0, winning_trades=0, losing_trades=0, fees_paid=0.0, realized_pnl=0.0)
- **TradeStat instantiation**: Fixed `real_trading_engine.py` line 89 to use proper field initialization
- **Model configuration**: Added `model_config` with `validate_assignment=True` and `extra="ignore"` for safer Pydantic v2 behavior
- **Risk summary**: Fixed missing `critical_alerts` key in `risk_manager.py` when risk_history is empty

#### Windows Compatibility
- **uvloop**: Made optional with clear documentation (Linux/macOS only)
- **ta-lib**: Made optional with installation instructions for all platforms
- **requirements.txt**: Updated with platform-specific guidance and comments
- **Setup scripts**: Created `scripts/setup.ps1` (Windows) and `scripts/setup.sh` (Linux/macOS)

#### Market Data & Symbol Handling
- **Kraken xStocks support**: Updated symbol mappings to use correct xStocks format (TSLAx, AAPLx, SPYx, etc.)
- **Symbol validation**: Added `_is_supported_symbol()` method to validate symbols before subscription
- **Symbol routing**: Enhanced `_normalize_symbol()` to handle crypto (BTC/USD ‚Üí XBT/USD) and xStocks (TSLA ‚Üí TSLAx/USD)
- **Error handling**: Reject unsupported symbols with clear logging instead of attempting invalid subscriptions
- **Symbol constants**: Added `SUPPORTED_CRYPTO` and `SUPPORTED_XSTOCKS` sets for validation

#### WebSocket Broadcast Robustness
- **Default schema**: Added safe default structure in `ws.py broadcast()` method
- **Missing keys**: Automatically inject default values for `critical_alerts`, `warnings`, `info` if missing
- **Defensive programming**: Check payload structure before broadcasting to prevent KeyError

#### Discord Rate-Limit Handling
- **HTTP 429 handling**: Implemented proper rate-limit detection with `retry_after` header parsing
- **Exponential backoff**: Added intelligent backoff when rate limited
- **Notification queue**: Implemented `deque`-based queue for pending notifications
- **Background processor**: Added async task to process notifications with rate limiting
- **Startup debounce**: Collect strategy creation messages during startup and send as single summary
- **Minimum interval**: Enforce 0.5s minimum between notifications to prevent spam
- **Graceful shutdown**: Properly clean up notification queue and flush pending messages

### ‚ú® Added

#### Configuration & Safety
- **REAL_TRADING flag**: New `real_trading` config field (0 or 1) as extra safety layer
- **is_live_trading property**: Computed property checking all conditions for live trading
- **Safety module**: New `crippel/safety.py` with startup checks and banners
- **Live trading countdown**: 10-second warning with Ctrl+C cancel option
- **Paper trading banner**: Clear visual indicator for safe mode
- **Configuration validation**: Added `validate_environment()` to check for common issues

#### Logging & Observability
- **Health endpoints**: Added `/api/healthz` for Kubernetes-style health checks
- **Readiness endpoint**: Added `/api/readyz` with component status checks
- **Version info**: Added version to startup logs and health responses
- **Structured logging**: Enhanced logging context throughout the system
- **Safety banners**: Visual terminal banners for trading mode

#### Developer Experience
- **Setup scripts**: Automated dependency installation for Windows and Linux/macOS
- **Makefile**: Comprehensive targets for lint, test, format, typecheck, run, clean
- **make.ps1**: Windows PowerShell equivalent of Makefile
- **.env.example**: Detailed environment variable template with documentation
- **README.md**: Complete documentation with quick start, configuration, architecture
- **Type hints**: Ensured all functions have proper type annotations

### üîÑ Changed

#### Configuration
- **Trading mode**: Changed from `"paper"/"live"` to `"paper"/"real"` for clarity
- **live_trading_enabled**: Replaced boolean with `real_trading` integer (0/1) for explicit safety
- **Model config**: Added `extra="ignore"` to all Pydantic models for forward compatibility
- **Symbol mappings**: Updated from generic format to Kraken-specific format with xStocks

#### Architecture
- **NotificationService**: Complete refactor with queue-based processing and rate limiting
- **Kraken adapter**: Enhanced with proper symbol validation and routing
- **WebSocket manager**: Added defensive defaults to prevent KeyError
- **Risk manager**: Fixed get_risk_summary() to always include required fields

### üìö Documentation

- **README.md**: Comprehensive guide with installation, configuration, usage, and troubleshooting
- **CHANGELOG.md**: This file documenting all changes
- **.env.example**: Detailed environment variable reference
- **Setup scripts**: In-line documentation for platform-specific setup
- **Code comments**: Enhanced docstrings and inline comments throughout

### üß™ Testing

- **Test preparation**: All fixes designed to be testable
- **Manual testing**: Backend startup with clean output
- **Automated testing**: Ready for pytest and integration tests

### üì¶ Dependencies

- Updated `requirements.txt` with platform-specific notes
- Made `uvloop` optional (Linux/macOS only)
- Made `ta-lib` optional with installation guidance
- No breaking dependency changes

---

## Known Limitations

1. **xStocks availability**: Kraken xStocks not available in US, Canada, UK, Australia, and some EU countries
2. **ta-lib**: Requires native C library, optional but recommended for advanced technical analysis
3. **uvloop**: Windows not supported (Python limitation, not critical)

---

## Migration Guide

### From Previous Version

1. **Update environment variables**:
   ```bash
   # Old
   CRIPPEL_TRADING_MODE=live
   CRIPPEL_LIVE_TRADING_ENABLED=true
   
   # New
   CRIPPEL_TRADING_MODE=real
   CRIPPEL_REAL_TRADING=1
   ```

2. **Stock symbols**: System now automatically handles xStocks format
   - Before: Manual symbol conversion
   - After: Automatic conversion (TSLA ‚Üí TSLAx/USD)

3. **Re-run setup**: Use new setup scripts for clean environment
   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   bash scripts/setup.sh
   
   # Windows
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\setup.ps1
   ```
